# Graphics Algorithms

## What is it?

This project includes Python implementations of various computer graphics algorithms. Each algorithm is designed to perform specific tasks related to drawing and manipulating geometric shapes. The implementations use the Pygame library for visualization.

## Included Algorithms

- Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA)
- Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm
- Mid Point Circle Drawing
- Mid Point Ellipse Drawing
- Basic Transformations (Rotation, Scaling, Translation)

## Instructions
Invoke the following command from within the shell -

#### <u>Installing the dependencies </u>

```shell
cd Graphics
pip install requirements.txt
```

#### Starting the project

```shell
python -m CG
```
